EDA on Shark Tank US Dataset
Overview
The aim of this project is to perform exploratory data analysis on the Shark Tank US dataset. The dataset contains information on the various pitches made to the Sharks and the resulting deals made on the show. By analyzing this data, we can gain insights into the success rates of different types of pitches and identify patterns in the Sharks' investment decisions.

Data Source
The dataset is obtained from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/akram24/sharktank

Technologies Used
Python
Jupyter Notebook
Pandas
Numpy
Matplotlib
Seaborn

Steps Involved
1. Data Cleaning and Preparation:
Cleans and prepares the data using Python and Pandas, including removing null values, correcting errors, and transforming the data into a usable format.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis:
Performs exploratory data analysis on the cleaned dataset, including descriptive statistics, data visualization, and correlation analysis.

3. Hypothesis Testing:
Conducts hypothesis testing on the dataset to test various hypotheses related to the success rates of different types of pitches and the factors that affect the Sharks' investment decisions.

4. Conclusion:
Summarizes the findings of the analysis and draws conclusions about the success rates of different types of pitches and the factors that affect the Sharks' investment decisions.

Conclusion
This project demonstrates how to perform exploratory data analysis on the Shark Tank US dataset using Python and various data analysis libraries. By following the steps outlined in this project, one can gain valuable insights into the success rates of different types of pitches and the factors that affect the Sharks' investment decisions.
